How to set interface files (currently just less) to autocompile.


1. Install node (http://nodejs.org/)


2. Run the following in your console (to install globally):

> sudo npm install -g less
> sudo npm install -g grunt-cli

If you wish to install locally, remove 'sudo' and '-g' from the above line. Modules will then be installed into the current folder.


3. Run the following in your console:

> npm install

This will take the settings from 'package.json' file and install all necessaty dependencies into node_modules/ folder.


4. Make sure you add the folder node_modules/ to your .gitignore!


5. Run the following in your console:

> grunt watch


6. Enjoy!
